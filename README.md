This code aims at mapping (T1/T2) MRI images with dielectric properties (e.g. conductivity & permittivity). 

This code is compatable with Mathematica 12.0 and byond and tested over Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04, and OSX 10.11.6. More details are in our papers mentioned below. If you are using this code, please cite our papers.

-> Input images are in MATLAB "*.mat" formats for easy use

-> To Run Select Evaluation -> Evaluate Notebook

-> If you are not familier with Mathematica Notebooks (*.nb), you can download free reader from here: http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/

"CondNet.nb"

This notebook will train the CondNet architecture to estimate dielectric properties. . Input: MRI images (T1 & T2), labels of Conductivity, Permittivity, and Tissue Densiy Output: Trained Network + loss function (training/validation) values

"Test_All.nb"

This notebook will use a pretrained network to estimate diectric properties.
